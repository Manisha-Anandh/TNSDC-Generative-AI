# TNSDC-Generative-AI
GAN-based Signal Processing
This repository explores the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for signal processing tasks. The implemented model aims to learn underlying patterns and complexities within signal data by generating realistic, synthetic signals.

Key Features:

LSTM-based Generator: Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively handle sequential signal data.

Multi-Layer Discriminator: Enhances the model's ability to distinguish between real and generated signals through a robust discrimination process.

Adversarial Training: Employs an adversarial training approach where the generator and discriminator compete, leading to the generator's improvement in creating realistic signals.

Potential Applications:

Data Augmentation: Generate synthetic data to enrich training datasets, particularly when real-world signal data is limited.

Anomaly Detection: Identify and flag unusual patterns in signals by comparing them to the "normal" patterns learned by the GAN.

Signal Denoising: Train the model to generate denoised versions of real signals, potentially improving signal quality.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python (>=3.6) with necessary libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch installed.

Data Preparation: Preprocess your signal data and ensure it's in a format suitable for the model.

Model Training: Run the training script (train.py) to train the GAN model on your prepared dataset.

Evaluation: Visualize generated signals and compare them to real signals to assess the model's performance. Utilize relevant metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, signal-to-noise ratio) for quantitative evaluation.

Future Work:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance for your specific signal processing task.

Advanced Architectures: Explore more complex GAN architectures like Conditional GANs or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for potentially richer signal processing capabilities.

Real-world Applications: Apply the trained model to address specific signal processing challenges in your domain.

This repository provides a foundational framework for exploring GANs in signal processing. We encourage further development and exploration to unlock the full potential of this approach.
